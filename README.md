COP2360 Module 07 – Dictionary and Switch Statement
Project Overview

This project was developed as part of COP2360: C# Programming – Module 07 (Collections).
It demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a C# Dictionary using a switch statement to perform multiple operations.
The goal is to help students understand how to use data collections, manage key-value pairs, and apply enumeration methods in real-world programming.

Features

Populate a dictionary with custom key-value pairs.

Display dictionary contents using enumeration.

Remove a key from the dictionary.

Add a new key-value pair.

Append a new value to an existing key.

Sort dictionary keys alphabetically.

Use a switch statement to navigate user options.

How It Works

When the program runs, the user is presented with a menu to perform dictionary operations.

Each menu option corresponds to a switch-case block that executes a specific task (add, display, remove, etc.).

The program continues to loop until the user chooses to exit.
